# **Chicago 311 — Applied Analytics**

![alt text](image.png)

This repository is an **applied study** of **Data Science** and **ML Engineering**, using **[Chicago 311 Service Requests data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests/v6vf-nfxy/about_data)**.

## **Study Roadmap**

**Core Objective:** 

**Simulate the end-to-end lifecycle of an Intelligence Solution**, meant to be used for planning and management teams, through creating:

- **Data Science study case [notebooks]()**, using   with **CRISP-DM** oriented methodology (e.g. business/domain understanding, data understanding, data exploration, modeling, evaluation and deployment).

- **Production-ready [web app]()**, applying **MLOps** princpiples like automated pipelines for ingestion and retraining, monitoring, CI/CD and IaC.

### **1 — First Cycle**

**End-to-end CRISP-DM flow**, from domain understanding to deployment, with the following order:

`Preprocess → EDA → Modeling → App`

- **Preprocessing**
- **EDA**
- **Forecasting Models**  
- **Web App Deploy**   

### **2 — Ongoing development and integration**

Using what was learned and the app infraestructure, further explore and model complementary problems with different models, then **deploy and integrate** into the existing pipeline:

#### **Intended Modeling Examples**

- Clustering / Segmentation
- Spike / Anomaly Detection  
- Production Demand Inference
- SLA Breach Risk Scoring 
- Crew Allocation Optimization  
- Policy Backtesting & Simulation
