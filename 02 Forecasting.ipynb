    "\n",
    "In real life, service request volumes can vary significantly over time, driven by seasonality and differences across service types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this variability, staffing and resource allocation decisions are commonly made in a **manual and reactive manner**, relying on historical averages and short-term intuition rather than systematic forecasts, often leading to operational inefficiency such as:\n",
    "- **Understaffing** during **peak periods**, resulting in:\n",
    "    - increasing service backlogs;\n",
    "    - delayed response times  \n",
